	"To the left, there is a periodic table. Hover over an element in order to enlarge it. Information about each element is shown in the boxes.",
	"The small periodic shows groups in the table. These are the alkali metals, which are very reactive and form strongly alkaline hydroxides, the alkaline earth metals, which are similar but less reactive and form an oxide coating when touched by oxygen, transition metals, which conduct electricity, have luster, and are malleable, metalloids, which have properties of metals and nonmetals, halogens, which are very reactive, esp. with salts, noble gases, which are very stable and unreactive, lanthanides, which are different from transition metals because their electrons are shielded from the atom's environment, and actinides, which are similar to transition metals but radioactive.",
	"At the top right of each box, there is a number. This is the atomic number. It increases from left to right and top to bottom. It is equal to the number of protons in the element.",
	"At the middle of each box is the symbol for each element. Below the symbol, there is a word and another number. The word is the full name of the element. The number is the atomic mass of the element. This is the combined mass of the protons and neutrons of an atom of that element in amu, where each proton and each neutron are 1 amu. Electrons do not contribute significantly to this number",
	"Think about how you can use the atomic mass and atomic number of an element to determine the number of neutrons in the element. Click next when you think you have it.",
	"The number of neutrons is equal to the rouned atomic mass minus the atomic number! Another thing to note is that in an atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of neutrons.",
	"However, as you may have noticed, the atomic mass is not an integer. This is not due to the mass of an electron. This is actually because not all atoms of an element have the same number of electrons. Each atom of an element with a unique number of neutrons is an isotope of that element.",
	"Some isotopes appear more frequently in nature than others. Therefore, instead of finding the average mass of all the isotopes of the element, we must find the weighted average. Here is an example:<br>If 99% of hydrogen atoms have a mass of 1 amu (0 neutrons) and 1% have 2 amu (one neutron), this means that the weighted average atomic mass of hydrogen is (.99 &times; 1) + (.01 * 2) = .99 + .02 = 1.01 amu",
	"The way to find this value is by multiplying the abundance of each isotope (.99 and .01) as a decimal by the atomic mass of each corresponding isotope (1 and 2), and then finding the sum of all of the products.",
	"This whole time, we've been dealing with atoms, but not all forms of an element are atoms. A particle is an atom only if it has the same number of protons and electrons. Otherwise, it is an ion. Each ion has a charge, which is the number of protons minus the number of electrons. What would the charge of an atom be?",
	"The charge of an atom would be 0. You may have also figured out that if there are more electrons than protons, the charge is negative, and if there are more protons than electrons, the charge is positive. These ions have special names, which are anions and cations, respectively.",
	"Electrons in an atom/ion come in energy levels, or certain distances from the nucleus of the atom/ion, where the protons and neutrons reside. The ones on the outermost energy level are called valence electrons. When an atom becomes an ion, it will either gain enough electrons to have 8 valence electrons or lose enough electrons to have 0 valence electrons, at which point the next lowest energy level becomes the valence electron shell, which will have 8 electrons.",
	"The number of valence electrons in an <b>atom</b> of an element is equal to the column it is in, not counting the cyan or purple columns, as they all contain 2. For example, lithium (Li) has 1 valence electron, magnesium (Mg) has 2, cerium (Ce) has 2, aluminum (Al) has 3, and so on. The only exception is helium (He), which has 2.",
	"For this reason, the number of electrons an atom would gain/lose to become an ion is determined by its column. The first column loses 1, the second column loses 2, the fifth non-cyan column gains 3, etc. However, the first column would not gain 7, because it always picks the option with the lowest number of electrons gained/lost, and losing 1 electron takes less electrons than gaining 7.",
	"However, there are two strange columns here. All of the cyan elements are called transition metals. The fourth non-transition metal column can lose or gain 4 electrons, since neither involves less than the other. The elements in the right column don't gain or lose any electrons, since they already have 8 valence electrons (again, helium is an exception). This means that those right-most elements, called noble gases, cannot become ions.",
	"What we're getting at here is the oxidation number, or charge, that atoms of elements will acquire when they for ions. For example, oxygen would gain 2 electrons. This means that it would then have 8 protons and 10 electrons, giving it a charge of 8 - 10 = -2.",
	"Look at the key below the next button. There is plenty of useful information there to explain. Energy levels are fixed distances from the nucleus where electrons are likely to be found. The energy level of the valence electrons of a non-transition metal atom is determined by its period, or row. For example, hydrogen (H) is on period 1, so its valence electrons are on the first energy level, and flerovium (Fl) is on period 7, so its valence electrons are on the seventh energy level.",
	"However, not all electrons in an energy level move the same way. Each energy level can have different sub-levels, which are s, p, d, and f. These describe shapes along which different electrons are likely to be found on each energy level. Each of these has a different number of orbitals, as described by the key, and each of these orbitals can contain up to 2 electrons.",
	"One way to represent the positions of electrons in an atom is with electron configurations. Remember that each time the atomic number increases by 1, the number of electrons increases by 1. In electron configurations, there are three main parts: the energy level, the sub-level, and the number of electrons in that sub-level. They are written like this: 1s<sup>2</sup>.",
	"Atoms with multiple energy levels or sub-levels have these chunks written consecutively, like this: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>. In fact, that would be the electron configuration for neon (Ne). Notice how they move accross and down the table.",
	"If you are traversing the d and f sub-levels, there is one change you must make: the energy level will be the period minus 1 for d and minus 2 for f, as stated in the key. For example, arsenic (As) would be written as ...3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup><b>3</b>d<sup>10</sup>4p<sup>3</sup>.",
	"When representing an atom in the f sub-level, remember to add a d electron before the f sub-level. However, when representing a transition metal after lanthanum (La), something like 5d<sup>1</sup>4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>9</sup> should be summarized into 4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>. Notice how the one La electron got grouped with the remaining 9 d electrons.",
	"This is called longhand configuration. However, if you don't feel like writing out the entire thing, you can also use noble gas shorthand configuration. It is where you substitute everything before the last s sub-level with the preceding noble gas. For example, lithium (Li) may be written as: [H]2s<sup>1</sup>.",
	"There are also many other properties an atom or an ion can have. One of these properties is atomic radius. Atomic radius is larger in elements that are near the left or bottom of the table than elements that are near the top or right. However, the exact opposite trend is present in electronegativity (tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself), electron affinity (energy released or spent when an electron is added to a neutral atom), and ionization energy (energy required to remove an electron from an atom's valence electron shell).",
"These can be explained by forces inside the atom. Electrons repel electrons due to having the same charge, and protons attract electrons due to having opposite charges. However, proton attraction is stronger than electron repulsion.Therefore, an increase in atomic number decreases the atomic radius unless it creates a new energy level. The closer electrons are to the protons, the harder they are to remove, which explains the ionization energy trend.",
"If an atom wants to lose an electron to become an ion, it loses energy after gaining the electron, and vice versa. This explains the electron affinity trend and why it is positive for nonmetals and negative for metals. Electronegativity is how strongly an atom attracts electrons in a bond with another atom. If it loses an electron, it doesnâ€™t attract electrons, and vice versa. This explains the electronegativity trend and why it is the same as electron affinity.",
